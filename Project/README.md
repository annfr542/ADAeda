# Title

# Abstract
We all need to eat to live, but how many of us live to eat? According to World Health Organization (WHO), obesity is increasing. In 2016 39% of adults worldwide were overweight and 13% were obese. We would like to investigate how nutritional content in food affects the health of the population of two different countries, USA and France. We will use the Open Food Facts database for this project. 

The idea is to use nutritional data of food in the same category and compare the two countries. We will couple this with use of health statistics from WHO to see if differences in the nutritional data correspond with the differences in the health statistics.

Our goal is to discover whether the health statistics can be directly correlated to food not only for obesity but also other health factors. How does the food consumed affect the life of a person in the long run?

# Research questions
Is there a nutritional difference in the food consumed in France vs US that correlates with respectively country’s BMI and other health indices? 
Is there a nutritional difference in food targeted to difference age groups? 
Which country have the “best” food in the perspective of nutrition, fat, carbs, sugar and food additives in different categories? The categories will be food type specific such as bread, cereals or semifinished dishes.
