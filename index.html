            <p>
                According to the World Health Organization (WHO), obesity is increasing. The definition of obesity is as follows:
            </p>
            <blockquote cite="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight">
                <p><i>Overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health.</i></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> "Abnormal" fat accumulation is usually measured with Body Mass Index (BMI) for adults. A BMI over 25 is defined as overweight and a BMI over 30 is
                defined as obese. In 2016, 39% of adults worldwide were overweight and 13% were obese. WHO considers obesity an epidemic and calculated in 2017 that
                2.8 million people die every year due to being overweight or obese. Obesity is also considered an easily preventable epidemic by the WHO,
                as it in most cases can be prevented by consuming a healthy diet and doing physical exercise.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this analysis, packaged food products from two countries will by analysed by investigating 
                their nutritional information. Can one observe a relation between the nutrients in a country’s
                food and their current health status according the health indices given by the WHO? That is what
                we’re going to see today. 
            </p>
            <h3>Our Contestants</h3>
            <p>With noted overweight among 67,9% of the population and an average BMI of 29,1 our first contestant 
                is the big pizzaloving country on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, <b>USA</b>.

            <h3>Data</h3>
            <p>
               The dataset used to get nutritional facts about packaged foods in this analysis is the Open Food Facts database. The database is a non-profit open
               database, which means anyone all over the world can use the data and contribute to the database. In the database, there exists 459371 products from 
               France and 175661 products from the USA, which we divided in to two datasets, one for each country. We also downsampled the France dataset as it is
               significantly larger than the USA dataset.
            </p>
            <p>
                We worked with features regarding nutriments, such as energy per a 100g and sugars per a 100g, as well as product names and food categories. Names and
                food categories was used to categorize the data so we could compare nutritional values between the two countries with products in the same category.
                This was to make sure the comparisions would make sense: comparing the sugar content of a lollipop from the USA with the sugar content of a soup from
                France would not give a true image of our data.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the open nature of the database generates a lot of data, the contributions are, as of yet, not automatically checked. This generates a lot of
                missing values in the dataset, as well as errors and inconsistencies. Our process for cleaning the data was:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Remove all rows in which all columns had no values</li>
                <li>Remove all rows where no product name or product category was defined</li>
                <li>Set all nutriments to be a value between 0 and 100</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The last point was important because no nutriment can be more than a 100% of a product. Since each nutriment is defined per 100g, we set that the
                range should be between 0 and a 100. The only nutriment feature we did not do this for was energy_100g, as energy can be more than a 100 for a 100g.
            </p>
            <h3>Food categories</h3>
            <p>
                To compare different kinds of food, we created food categories. These were based on categories in the dataset that we decided to compile together.
                Our five categories are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fats</li>
                <li>Meat, poultry, fish</li>
                <li>Dairy</li>
                <li>Bread</li>
                <li>Snacks</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Some of these categories are divided in to subcategories as well, for example the category Snacks is divided in to the subcategories Sugary snacks and
                Salty snacks. For each category, we have chosen different nutriments to focus on, such as sugars per 100g for Sugary snacks.
            </p>
            <p>
                To classify our data into categories, we needed to define what kind of products that matched each category. Let's look at the category Fats as an
                example. First, we defined words that are associated with fats, such as butter and oil. We also made sure to use both English and French words to make
                sure to get as many matches as possible. Then, both datasets were queried to see the results of the filtering. If the results contained products we did
                not want, we defined words that were not fats. As an example, popcorn contains butter, but is not in itself a fat, so we filtered away all rows which
                had the word popcorn in the product name or category type.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will visualize the categories, their distribution and nutriment values to investigate what the products contain. France is represented by the color
                blue and the USA by the color red.
            </p>

            <h2>Fats</h2>
            <p>
                This category contains any food items that can be considered as pure fats, the type of fat that you could use for for example greasing a
                frying pan. This includes peanut butter as it is a kind of butter, which is a fat. We start by dividing the whole fat category into subcategories and mapping 
                items into 5 different item types: butter, cooking spray, margarin, oil and peanut butter. The distribution for these subcategories can be seen in the following plot. 
            </p>
            <figure class ="distributionFigure">
                <embed type="image/svg+xml" src="img/fats_distribution.svg" />
            </figure>
            <p>
                In the distribution plot we see that France has more different oils and butter while the US has a considerably higher percentage of peanut butters. As a side-note 
                we can also see that over half of the oils in France are olive oil, while olive oil only corresponds to less than a fourth of the oils in the US.
            </p>
            <p>
                We want to investigate the different types of fat that are prevalent in the fat items, as this is has a large health impact. In general it is better to eat 
                more unsaturated fats as this reduces the blood cholesterol levels. Saturated fats on the other hand can actually increase then blood cholesterol levels. Having
                a low blood cholesterol level decreases the change of heart disease. We therefore compare the amounts of saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats
                for the fat items between the countries:

                 </div>
            <p>
                Here we see clearly that the US has France has a higher amount of saturated fat, while the US has a higher amount of both monounsaturated fat and polyunsaturated fat.
                The reason for this might be that the US has such a large amount of peanut butter, which contains a large amount of unsatured fats (around 80% of the fat in peanut
                butter are unsatured). On the other hand, olive oil, which we noted were very prevalent in France compared to the US, does also contain large amounts of 
                unsaturated fats, which might weight up a bit against the peanut butter.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the unsaturated fats are good and the saturated fat is bad, the US wins this round.

                In this category we have chosen to look at different kinds of meats items, namely meat, poultry and fish products. While the raw meats 
                will probably not differ that much in nutriments, the reasoning behind the category is that the countries might have products with meats
                in them which also contain additional ingredients, for example a meat dish that is deep fried, or a meat item marinated in some kind of sauce.
                This information will be reflected on the food item's nutritional data and this is what will be compared between the two countries.

                We immediately observe that the amount of energy per 100g seems to be very similar for meat items from the two countries.
                We also protein levels for the two different countries seems to be fairly equal.
                However, as can be seen in the box plot for carbohydrates per 100g, food items from the US seems to contain much more of it per 100g 
                than food items from France. This observation could, as mentioned in the introduction of this category, be 
                explained by that the different countries prepare the food items differently with different ingredients. Possible hypoteses could be that
                the US have more things that are fried in oil, have a larger amount of sauces, have more marinated items or more items that comes wrapped in bread.
            </p>
            <p>
                To further investigate, we look at the amount of fat per 100g. Here we can see that the values for the US are actually lower, 
                which would suggest that the hypothesis of that more things are fried in oil in the US is wrong. So where does the big difference in fat come from?
                In our data analysis we took a closer look at the France data, 
                and found out that 76.84% of the meat items from France that have between 50g and 80g of fat per 100g are foie gras. This is something that 
                might explain the possibly surprising difference in amount of fats between the two countries, as foie gras is a typical French dish which is not really
                that common in the US.
            </p>
            <p>
                The amount of sugar is also considerably higher in the US than in France. This is no surprise given the results of the carbohydrates, the two
                are often correlated. 
            </p>
            <p>
                So to conclude this category, we have seen that in general, while the amount of energy per 100g of meat items is about the same for the both countries, 
                there is a rather clear difference in where the energy is stored. For meat items from the US: in carbohydrates and mainly sugar, for meat items from France:
                in fat. To decide which one is the most healthy here is a bit controversial, as the healthiness of fat is not well defined. In general though, eating 
                large amounts of sugar is not very good since it contains a lot of energy and is not very filling, resulting in that you can eat more. For this reason,
                this round goes to France.

            <h2>Dairy</h2>
            <p>
                This category consists of food items that we consider dairy, for example yoghurt, milk or cheese. We are not including butter in this category as we have already
                treated this in the fats category. To get a feeling for the different kinds of subcategories there are in this category we map the dairy items to descriptive 
                categories and plot their distributions, which can be seen below:
            </p>
            <figure class ="distributionFigure">
                <embed type="image/svg+xml" src="img/dairy_distribution.svg" />
            </figure>
            <p>
                From this figure we see that an large portion of the dairy items in both the US and France are cheese-related items. As a side-note we also see that a big part
                of the US cheese is the same cheese, namely Cheddar cheese (of which there only a very small part of the French cheese consists of). 
                For the other sub-categories we note that the US has almost the double amount of ice cream compared to France, and that France has almost double the amount 
                of milk compared to the US. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We now take a look at the nutrients in the dairy items. We have plotted the number of grams of different nutrients per 100g of food item in two different plots.
                Firstly one radar plot for sugar, carbohydrates, proteines, fat and the different types of fat, e.g. saturated, monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fat.
                Secondly we made one regular bar plot for sodium and calcium. The reason for the partitioning is simply that the figures for the nutrients in the radar plot
                are given in grams and are of equal size, while the figures for sodium and calcium are given as a fraction of the recommended daily intake. 
            </p>
            <figure class ="distributionFigure">
                <embed type="image/svg+xml" src="img/dairy_nutri_radar_big.svg" />
            </figure>
            <p>
                In the radar plot we see that the US have more of every nutrient. The reason for the higher amount of sugar in the US dairy items could simply be that 
                more products from the US have more sugar added to them. This would also affect and explain the higher amount of carbohydrates. The fact that the US had 
                double the amount of ice cream compared to France reinforces this theory. The higher amount of protein in the US could possibly also be explained by the 
                subcategory distribution. The larger amount of ice cream would not explain the protein surplus of the US, on the contrary it might actually support
                the inverse. The slightly larger amount of cheese in the US would definitely increase the amount of protein though. The higher amount of fats seems to 
                indicate that in general the dairy products in the US have a higher fat percentage.
            </p>
            <figure class ="distributionFigure">
                <embed type="image/svg+xml" src="img/dairy_nutri_small.svg" />
            </figure>
            <p>
                In the plot with sodium and calcium there is not much to add, in general the US has more sodium and France has more sodium.
            </p>
            <p>
                More proteins is not neccessarily a bad thing, but in a time of overconsumption where obesity is a great health risk there is really not anything good 
                with the US products having more of all of the nutriments which gives energy. The dairy items from France have a lower amount of sodium, which is something 
                that most people consume too much of in general with especially large amounts in for example fast food. The items from France also have a higher amount 
                of calcium, which is a good thing in general since it is an important mineral which has a bunch beneficial effects. 
                These are all the reasons why this round goes to France.

            <h2>Bread</h2>
            In this category we compare bread between the two countries. This does not include cookies, biscuits and sugary snacks made of grains.
            In our comparison we started by observing that there is a higher amount of bread-related items in the US compared to in France, 5404 compared to 3107. 
            The reason for this could be that buying bread at a bakery is much more common in France compared to in the US, resulting in that the demand for bread 
            as a product in stores is not as high.

        <p>
            Comparing bread items between the two countries we see that the energy values per 100g are very similar. However when it comes to carbohydrates, the US definitely has more.
            An interesting thing is that the bread items from the US have less sugar per 100g than bread items from France. This is unexpected, since carbohydrates and sugars often
            correlate. An explanation could be that France has more light bread with more sugar than the US, so that the carbohydrates in the US bread comes from the grains rather 
            than the sugar. This hypothesis is strenghtened when looking at the fiber per 100g, where the US has more (note that this plot is logaritmic).
        </p>
        <p>
            The difference in the amount of fat between the two countries are not very big, with france having just a little bit more in general. A guess of what could be causing
            this is that the bread in France in general have more butter and oil on it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Based on the stated observations, we conclude that the US has darker bread with less butter and oil on it compared to the bread from France. Both more darkness as well 
            as less butter/oil are things that we consider as good things, which is the reason the US wins this round.

                This category is divided in to two subcategories, Sugary snacks and Salty snacks. These also have smaller categories within themselves, such as
                Chocolates in Sugary snacks. The total amount of snacks in the France dataset was 22 364 while the USA had 31 544 entries. At the moment it is hard
                to know if this depends on the products added to the database or if the USA genuinely has more snacks than France does.

            <h3>Sugary snacks</h3>
            <p>
                In the graph the distribution of the subcategories in Sugary snacks is shown. France had a total of 18 164 sugary snacks and the USA has 11 177.
                As we can see, Chocolates are in the majority for both countries. However France still has a higher percentage of Chocolates than the USA does.
                Candy is the smallest category for both countries.

                For sugary snacks, we looked closer at the feature sugars per 100g and energy per 100g. Note that a maximum of 100 in the boxplot comes from higher
                values that were sampled down to 100.
